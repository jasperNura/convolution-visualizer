# 3D Convolution Neural Network Visualizer

A React TypeScript application using Three.js to visualize convolutional neural network operations in 3D space. This project creates an interactive stacked projection view of CNN layers showing the flow of data through the network. Its aim is to help build an intuition of how convolutional parameters affect the receptive field of the recursive receptive field

> I have no prior experience with React (or TypeScript) and a large portion of the initial work was done with Claude. Any PRs/issues for sections which are done in a non-idiomatic or inefficient way are welcome
